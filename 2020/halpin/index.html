        <h1>Growing together while staying apart</h1>

        <h2>Gardens brought neighborhoods together while local farms stepped up to keep them fed. The pandemic fostered a renewed sense of community in Massachusetts.</h2>

        <p>Britton Boughner already spent a lot of time with the plants in  his garden before the pandemic, but this year they became a refuge. “They were a reminder to me that while the rest of the world was falling apart the everyday cycle of life continues,” said Boughner.
        </p>
		<p>After his gym closed in March, Boughner, 63, replaced workouts with daily walks around his Lowell neighborhood. He gained a new appreciation for his home of 20 years, noticing small things like plants growing and shifting angles of sunlight. He made a habit of waving to everyone and met many of his neighbors for the first time. “It gave me an opportunity to connect with my neighborhood in a way I didn't before.”
		</p>
		<p>In early October, he passed apple trees weighed down with fruit, and approached the homeowner. Boughner picked and donated ten bags of apples to the Merrimack Valley Food Bank. “Hopefully, maybe, more people will be inspired to do their own thing and make a stronger community,” he said.</p>
      	<p>In the early weeks of the pandemic, days blended together behind closed doors, but outside, spring slowly arrived in Massachusetts as it alway does. Backyards, porches, and public parks became a therapeutic escape when there was nowhere to go, lots of time to kill and much to worry about. Seeing even long-time neighbors became an exciting social interaction. When grocery shelves were empty, people planted vegetable gardens and subscribed to local farm shares. What began as resourcefulness and a way of coping with isolation emerged as a path forward: community connection.
      	</p>

      	<h2>Planting seeds</h2> 

      	<p>Danielle Barlow was anxious and needed a distraction. The week before Massachusetts’ stay-at-home-advisory, she picked up seeds from the public library. Her husband built raised beds behind their Lynn home and Barlow, 35, planted all the starter plants she could get her hands on. “I decided this year was the year I was turning my brown thumb green,” she said. “I went balls to the walls.”

		<p>Danielle Barlow was anxious and needed a distraction. The week before Massachusetts’ stay-at-home-advisory, she picked up seeds from the public library. Her husband built raised beds behind their Lynn home and Barlow, 35, planted all the starter plants she could get her hands on. “I decided this year was the year I was turning my brown thumb green,” she said. “I went balls to the walls.” 
		</p>
		<p>WIth help from the internet, Barlow fell in love with growing food - harvesting tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, radishes, potatoes and herbs. While trying to use all of the fresh produce, Barlow started cooking healthier and more frequently. It became a cherished activity to do with her daughters, ages 10 and 2. 
		</p>
		<p>Instead of individual activities, the family now spends much of their time together and outside. Working on the garden and making plans together fostered communication and teamwork. Barlow plans to expand the growing area next season, with the goal of feeding more than her own family. 
		</p>
		<p>At the end of the season, they put up a 6-by-8 foot greenhouse to grow garlic, lettuce and herbs during the cold season. The three week installation in their side yard piqued the interest of typically reserved neighbors who stopped by to ask about the structure. Barlow, a self-described introvert, began trading tips and vegetables with them. Though she’d lived in the neighborhood for five years, she discovered for the first time that many people around her were growing food in their backyards. 
		</p>

        </div>

        <p>“I have no problem reaching out, especially within my own community,” said Barlow who joined several Facebook groups of local gardeners. “It was a really good mental change for me.”
        </p>
        <p>Amid social distancing, gardeners like Barlow connected virtually. Novices sought advice from those old hands, while strangers exchanged seeds and proudly posted photos of their projects. Hank Melvin, who runs the Jamaica Plan Garden Group on Facebook, said it added 300 new members since March. It took a couple years to reach 800 members before that. 
        </p>	
		<p>Already a gardener for several decades, Faith Girdler appreciated it “ten times more” this year. She has met a number of people through Melvin’s group as well as the Boston Area Gardeners, a Facebook community with more than 2,000 members. “I have discovered that gardeners are the most generous, friendly folks in the world,” she said.
		</p>

		<h2>Burgeoning demand</h2>

		<p>Just as schools and work became virtual, so did traditionally hands-on garden trainings. Kevin Cody who oversees Tufts University's crop production program said there was a significant uptick in enrollment during the pandemic. Classes typically held at Moraine Farm in Beverely were online - and now accessible to people who wouldn’t be able to attend in-person, especially those in more rural areas.
		</p>
		<p>“We’re also seeing folks who are getting turned on to farming, making a living being outdoors,” said Cody. “The business class enrollment is higher than it's ever been.” He expects the program to continue in a hybrid format because the online component has been so successful at creating engagement.
		</p>
		<p>Students were able to volunteer on the farm, weeding, planting, and harvesting with the New Entry Sustainable Farming Project. The organization partners with Tufts to train new farmers, helps them launch a sustainable business through an incubator program, and connects them with direct-to-consumer (DTC) and wholesale customers. Cody said the volunteer experience took on a new meaning this year. “The value of outdoor work and connecting to the land are likely to persist.”
		</p>

          <figcaption class="mi-image">Photo: Boston Area Gleaners</figcaption>
        </div>

		<p>The Boston Area Gleaners also received significant interest from new volunteers this year. The non-profit organization works with 80 local farms to harvest surplus crops and distribute them to hunger relief organizations in the region. But, Executive Director Usha Thakrar said there were fewer gleaning opportunities this year due to the drought and high demand for local food. When national grocery supply chains were interrupted at the beginning of the pandemic, Massachusetts residents sought alternatives from closer to home. Farmers simply had less surplus to donate. 
		</p>
		<p>“People were beginning to understand how local food is a much more accessible resource,” said Thakrar.
		</p>
		<p>Consumers suddenly wanted fresh, local food at the same time farms lost many of their wholesale customers, like restaurants, schools and other institutions forced to close due to the pandemic. It was a significant shift for farmers.
		</p>
		<p>Operating a DTC farm business - selling through farmer’s markets and community supported agriculture (CSA) programs - costs more than selling to wholesale clients. Jacob Weiss, New Entry’s Food Hub Manager said subscriptions to its weekly CSA had been declining in recent years - and their experience was not unique. The USDA Agricultural Census reported a 17.7% decrease in DTC farms in Massachusetts between 2012 and 2017.
		</p>
		<p>This year, Thakra said all of the Gleaner’s DTC farm partners struggled to keep up with the consumer demand. Every CSA was sold out or expanded for the season. Siena Farms, a sustainable farm in Sudbury, said its weekly CSA subscriptions swelled from 500 boxes to more than 2,000 for the 2020 season. The farm is already accepting sign-ups for next year.
		</p>

          <figcaption class="mi-image">Photo: Siena Farms</figcaption>
        </div>

        <p>Massachusetts farmers are cautiously optimistic the demand and sales will carry forward, as consumers continue to value local food. “One of the best ways for people to appreciate the food they buy is to grow it themselves,” said Cody.
        </p>
        <p>After realizing how fragile her dependence on grocery stores was, Lee Nelson planted a variety of fruits and vegetables in containers on her deck for the first time. Even though she didn't end up really needing the food she grew, Nelson is grateful for her new skills. “It gave me something to look forward to every day.” As the summer ended, Nelson planted greens, peas, potatoes and radishes to harvest through mid-fall and early winter.
        </p>
        <p>“We would like to believe that [the pandemic] has highlighted the importance of local agriculture and supporting that infrastructure,” said Thakrar. “We’ll see if it’s sustainable or if people revert back to really wanting watermelon in January.”
        </p>
        <p>While no one knows what the 2021 season will be like, Thakrar and Cody say the recent investment in infrastructure to support a robust local food system is a promising sign.
        </p>

        <h2>Growing resilience</h2>

        <p>Massachusetts created a food security task force to address the soaring demand for food assistance during COVID-19. One of the task force recommendations was to direct funding for agricultural infrastructure, including delivery trucks, coolers, farming equipment and buildings, to meaningfully address food insecurity in the state in the long term. 	
        </p>
        <p>Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker announced the $36 million <a href="https://www.mass.gov/service-details/food-security-infrastructure-grant-program">Food Security Infrastructure Grant Program</a> in May. Three rounds of grants have already been awarded, primarily to local farms and public schools, with more to come.
        </p>
        <p>The program was welcome news to farmers who were experiencing distribution bottlenecks. Cody believes these types of grants are an important piece of the puzzle to improving access to healthy, local food. “Smaller investments can greatly expand an operation,” he said. 
        </p>

        <div class="mi-image">

          <figcaption class="mi-image">Photo: Boston Area Gleaners</figcaption>
        </div>

		<p>The state also dedicated $12 million to purchase and distribute local food boxes to families across the state. Similarly, the Boston Area Gleaners were awarded a contract in the first two rounds of USDA’s <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/selling-food-to-usda/farmers-to-families-food-box">Famers to Families Food Box</a> program, created to support local farmers and address growing food needs during the pandemic. 
		</p>
        <p>The Gleaners were already experienced and equipped to collect and distribute local food. Being able to pay the farmers was a bonus. The organization sprung into action during what is usually the quietest period of the year. After the USDA changed box requirements, Thakrar said they decided not to apply for the subsequent rounds, but continued to help with distribution through the third round, which ended in October. In total, the Gleaners distributed over 4 million pounds of food through the major food pantries and partner organizations. 
        </p>
        <p>“It started off as a very useful program and has been tremendous value to people on the ground,” said Thakrar. No contracts were awarded in Massachusetts in the fourth round and she says the impact on food pantries is palpable. 
        </p>

        <h2>Cultivating Community</h2>

        <p>In Boston, residents have come together to meet the need for fresh, healthy food in their own neighborhoods. On sidewalks in Jamaica Plain, Dorchester, Rosilindate and Allston, newly installed, brightly-painted refrigerators encourage people to take what they need or donate what they can. “Host” businesses provide the electricity while volunteers ensure the appliances stay clean and stocked. Local businesses, including Allandale Farm and When Pigs Fly Bread regularly supplement community donations, including homegrown fruits and vegetables.
        </p>
        <p>Relationships with people in close proximity became more significant in the absence of regular social interactions with friends, family and coworkers. 
        </p>
		<p>In her fifth year as a Fenway Victory Gardener, Christine Nelson noticed her garden neighbors more present than not this year. She was in her garden nearly every day since March. “It's been great to see familiar faces when so much of our social connections have been challenged this year,” she said. The Fenway Victory Gardens are one of 175 community gardens within the City of Boston, which touch more than 18,000 individuals and families each year.
		</p>
		<p>Laid off from her restaurant job with nothing in particular to do, Kate LeAnn passed the days on her porch and took daily walks around the neighborhood. Her neighbors were also around more often. In the previous six years, they had only interacted in passing. 
		</p>
		<p>LeAnn, 38, worked extra hard tending the tomatoes, peppers and herbs in a raised bed her landlord let her use this year. His daughter planted in the second bed. The garden was an entry to small talk. “It was fun sharing it with friends and neighbors,” she said.
		</p>
        <p>Cooking dinner on the porch, LeAnn would chat with her retired nextdoor neighbor about his various home projects. “We had the time to sit and carry on a conversation rather than rush around.” Since she returned to work in July, she doesn’t see her neighbors as often, but said she is grateful for the mental readjustment.
        </p>
        <p>“It feels cozier and more neighborhood, which is nice because it’s so easy to be surrounded by strangers,” LeAnn said. “It feels more like a home than a place.”
        </p>
