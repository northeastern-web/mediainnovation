<h1 class="headline">A Boom of Uncertainty: Pregnancy During The Pandemic</h1>

 <h3 style="text-align: center;font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">By Ryan Corbin, Szu Yu Chen, and Sofia Perez</h3>

     <p>Would the hospital allow the partner to present during the childbirth and post birth? Would physically connecting with friends and family be dangerous? Is continuing with the pregnancy during a lockdown a feasible option? </p>
        
   <p>Pregnancy is a time of great stress - you worry about everything from eating the right foods to exercising enough but not too much - and with a highly transmissive virus comes into play, it involves more isolation, loneliness and fear out of the unknown. </p>
        
    <p>Juliet Murray almost had a panic attack in a vegetable aisle when a man stormed towards a bag of salads besides her. Although they were both wearing a mask, thinking of potentially getting exposed to the virus and not being able to protect the baby in her belly, Murray nearly cried in the store.  "I was so terrified ...just because I saw somebody blatantly disregarding social distancing," said Murray. </p>
        
    <p>Murray discovered her unplanned pregnancy in March last year. It was the beginning of the virus outbreak. People thought it was just a flu and never expected it to shut down the entire country for more than one year. </p>

        <p>For the first two months of her pregnancy, she completely isolated herself at home, not seeing anyone, including her fiance, who worked as a liquor distributor. "It was just so unknown. The fear of ... what I am bringing a baby into was really scary because I wanted to protect my baby from anything from day one," said Murray. She did everything she could, from frequently washing her hands and strictly social distancing to always wearing a mask and avoiding going out. 

           <p>But still, she questioned herself whether that was enough to protect her baby against the virus. "I had to go to the hospital for appointments. I had to deliver traditionally in a hospital. it was unavoidable." </p>
            
           <p> Murray drove herself to her first in-person doctor appointment, checked in while standing six feet away from the desk, distanced from others waiting in the room by themselves. "We are all alone," she thought. The doctors and nurses were in full protective gear but she only had a thin cloth of mask. Trivials things, such as the buttons in the elevator or the arms of a chair, that Murray had taken for granted her whole life suddenly became anxiety provoking. </p>
            
           <p> She was allowed to face-time with her family during the ultrasound. She held the phone in, laid back and heard the first heartbeat with her parents and fiance on the other end of the phone. "My mom started crying ... I'm pretty sure my dad cried too, even though he was pretending he wasn't crying," said Murray. </p>
            
            <p>Before the first ultrasound, Murray sometimes wondered whether there was really a small person living in her body because she hadn't felt much. "Hearing that first heartbeat and seeing the little blob on the ultrasound ... just made it real," said Murray. She was ecstatic and wanted to be around everyone she loves. She wanted to shout out, "Hey! I am pregnant!" But that never happened. She left the hospital and drove herself home. "That was all there was to do. I went home and quarantined," said Murray.</p>

            <p>The feelings of anxiety and loneliness Murray felt were shared by many. </p>

<p>Around 60 percent of pregnant people are reporting feeling levels of stress and anxiety that interfere with their daily functioning, according to Laura Jelliffe-Pawlowski, the lead researcher of an international study focused on how COVID-19 are affecting pregnant and birthing people. "We're seeing higher levels than we've seen in any of the other studies," said Dr. Jelliffe-Pawlowski.</p>

    <p>The reasons vary. Some are concerned about getting infected, some fear being socially isolated and others are worried about the constantly changing hospital practices. According to Dr. Jelliffe-Pawlowski, more than 90 percent of the research participants indicate they stay connected to family and friends. "But having those people doesn't mean that you're not feeling depressed and lonely and scared," said Dr. Jelliffe-Pawlowski.</p>
    
    <p>Rebecca Joachim, director of Crisis Services at Boston Center for Pregnancy Choices, held a similar point of view. "I" definitely think that there's been an increase in depression," said Joachim. She spent more time than usual counseling clients to ensure they received the support they needed. "It can be really isolating and difficult ... Counseling would be a huge piece specifically for moms and especially looking at postpartum depression," said Joachim. </p>
    
   <p>Many sought support and suggestions from online forums like r/Pregnant, a subreddit for people to share their pregnancy and laboring experience. </p>

  

   <p>Using a dictionary researchers developed to rate words for positivity and negativity, we examined the average sentiment of the 44,000 posts from Jan. 2020 to Jan 2021</p>
   <p> The mood on r/Pregnant drastically turned negative in mid-March, when COVID-19 cases started rising in the U.S. "COVID-19," "stay home" and "social distance" topped the most used words. </p>

<p>With hospitals straining under the influx of patients and the potentially severe recession following the lockdown, many decided to delay childbearing. </p>
 
   <p> The Brookings Institute estimates that as many as 300,000 fewer children could be born in 2021. Overall, one in three U.S. women said they wanted to get pregnant later or have fewer children because of COVID-19, according to a Guttmacher Institute study.</p>

   <h2>Percentage of women reporting
    wanting to delay childbearing or have fewer kids</h2>

    <p>The drop in the number of children born this year follows a steady decline of the U.S. fertility rates that has been going on for decades. With a sharp decrease driven by the 2008 recession, the fertility rates hit a record low in 2019. Then came the pandemic, bringing many people face-to-face with an uncertain future and forcing them to make tough decisions about pregnancy. </p>

       <p> Molly, 30, White, had a significant pay cut. Her husband, with the pressure of the pandemic and losing a well-paid job, relapsed. </p>
        
        <p>Molly immediately started questioning whether she should keep the baby when she discovered her pregnancy in December last year. They had wanted a second child so their school-aged daughter would have a sibling. Molly went off birth control at the end of February, right before the pandemic hit. "We thought it (COVID-19) was going to be a short time," said Molly. But it lasted longer than they had ever imagined. </p>
        
       <p> "It just felt way too much ...  I felt like we were not in a place to really bring another person into our home. I made the choice to terminate," said Molly.</p>
        
       <p> On the abortion day, She arrived 30 minutes earlier at the doctor's office. No other people were allowed to go in with her due to the virus. Between the abortion pill and the procedure, she chose the latter. </p>
        
       <p> She put all her belongings in the locker, wore on a hospital gown and was given anesthesia. When she regained her consciousness, she was already in the recovery room. She cried a little, feeling strange. She needed some time to process it. </p>
        
       <p> "I felt some relief, in the days after ... I did feel confident in the decision," said Molly. </p>
         
       <p> "A lot of the people that I have seen have been furloughed ... or have lost their jobs," said Joachim. Clients that Joachim serve are mostly from lower income groups and have been struggling with financial burdens exacerbated by the pandemic. </p>
        
       <p> In the first quarter of 2020, African Americans had an unemployed rate of 6.3%, Latino workers at 4.8% and white workers at 3.1%, meaning African Americans had twice the unemployment rate in early 2020. Black and Latina women have seen jobs come back at a slower rate than white women.</p>
         
       <p> "These inequities are really profound in black and Latin people in terms of covid exposure and preterm birth. So it's really just one thing on top of another thing for these women," said Dr. Jelliffe-Pawlowski. "we've had several women say they had to choose between keeping their baby safe and having a job. or somebody saying they had to decide between having enough food for their family or exposing their fetus to infection." </p>
         
       <p> Black and Hispanic women were more likely than White women to state that they wanted to delay pregnancy and were also more concerned about accessing sexual and reproductive health service, according to the study.

        <p>Dashanna Hanlon, a 32-year-old doula and founder of Caring for Mamas serving mostly people of color, saw an increase in her clients choosing home birth especially in recent times with COVID-19. </p>

           <p> The uncertainties of the laboring process itself are frightening enough, not to mention delivering a baby alone. "People feel like they don't have a choice, especially with COVID and with their masks, they really aren't able to speak up," said Hanlon. </p>
            
           <p> Quintett Bowers, 29, Self-Identifying as Black Female, decided to do a homebirth for her 4th pregnancy. </p>
            
           <p> "With my doula, I just feel like they're just so much in tune to the mother and the baby, my doula did come here in my house. She met the family. We were just talking to each other. And it was just our energies, like our energies were on the same page. I felt extremely comfortable with her because she knows the ins and outs of it and she has several kids and she's been doing this for a while. And of course, she's black. So I feel like, you know, she has my best interests at heart. And we've been talking it. And she was asking me about. Massages. What type of music I want?" </p>

        </figure>
           <p>"I've been looking at different alternatives because I just know I don't want to have my baby in a hospital because that is where all the patients who are sick, that's where they are. And it's funny because, like before, you don't really think about like you're in a hospital where people are sick, where people are dying and you're going to this place to have a baby. You know, the bed that you're laying on, you don't know who was there before you. The sheets that you wrap that that you put over yourself, you don't know who had those sheets on before you. The nurses and doctors just coming in and out. You don't know who they've been in contact with at home or in the hospital. So it really open up your eyes like, oh, wow. Like, I never thought about this situation like this before. So I did find a doula and a midwife. So said, I've gone to a hospital, we will be at a birthing center. And I feel very, very more relaxed knowing that and knowing that, you know, I'm not exposing my baby to anything harmful will be in a relaxed environment. And I can just focus on the baby. And I don't have to focus on everything else, and especially now at the hospital."</p>

           <p>Devers has a comprehensive birth plan that includes detailed "objectives" to remind and help her husband advocate for her in the ways she wanted.</p>

        <p>However, some familiar problems remain: sharp inequalities in maternity deaths, unemployment rates, housing and care for expectant mothers. These existed long before the pandemic but were exacerbated by it. Murray traces her anxiety to the health system's lack of support for pregnant women, Molly's decision to seek an abortion was directly tied to economic fears, and confusing information about the vaccines' safety is at the root of many of Deavers concerns.</p>
