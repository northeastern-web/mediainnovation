            <h3>By March 2020, hospitals changed the visiting policies due to COVID-19. “We were really worried that my partner, Louis, wasn't going to be able to come in and be in the delivery room with me,” said Capek. “I was giving birth in two weeks and we had this whole birth plan and it needed to completely shift.” Capek agreed to induce the baby. She was pushing for three hours.“Looking back like my baby wasn't ready to come out. It was a really long labor” said Capek.

        <p>Covid-19 has reshaped many facets of human lives profoundly, from how we work and do grocery shopping to the way we reunite with our family and friends. Binge watching has replaced friends gathering. Online classes and meetings have become the new normal.But for some people, it's way beyond that. The scale of the pandemic has been extended to an even more personal decision in their lives, pregnancy.</p>
        <p>As Jen Schager nailed down her doctorate after 10 years of hard work in May 2020, <a href="https://nytimes.com" target="blank"> she finally started enjoying a more stable life </a> with her husband and was ready to have a baby. The pandemic was not a concern. "We've been waiting so long to have kids. We were not willing to postpone our family even longer due to the pandemic," said Schager. She had expected her pregnancy would be different from those in the non-COVID era but hadn't realized the challenges brought by the pandemic could be this frustrating.</p>
        <p>"I've not really had any of the typical pregnancy rites of passage, like people feeling my belly, asking me how far along I am...I haven't seen my mom in over a year, and that's been so tough that she hasn't seen me in person pregnant at all," said Schager.</p>
        <p>Like Schager, Lisa, 28, who works as a licensed real estate agent in Florida, also went through similar struggles. Many hospital visitor restrictions have been in place since March, forbidding partners from going to the appointments. Lisa's husband has to wait in the car while she meets with the doctor. "He has missed the first heartbeat," said Lisa.</p>
        <p>Posts on r/Pregnant, a Reddit forum for pregnant people to share experience, prove that they are not alone. Using a dictionary researchers developed to rate words for positivity and negativity, we examined the average sentiment of the 44,000 posts from Jan. 2020 to Jan 2021.</p>
            <img src="./images/placeholder.jpg">
        <p>The mood on r/Pregnant drastically turned negative in mid-March, when COVID-19 cases started rising in the U.S. “COVID-19”, “stay home” and “social distance” topped the most used words, suggesting concerns over the pandemic.</p>
        <p>As drug companies subsequently released news about the upcoming vaccines in November, both the number of posts and mood on r/Pregnant gradually increased. In January, the word vaccine was used 20% more compared to a year ago. </p>
        <p>One study published by HOPE COVID-19 further strengthens the trends, indicating that sixty percent of pregnant women are experiencing nervousness and anxiety at levels that impede their everyday functioning.</p>
            <img src="./images/placeholder.jpg">
        <p>With hospitals straining under the influx of patients and the potentially severe recession following the lockdown, many decided to delay childbearing.</p>
        <p>The Brookings Institute estimates that as many as 300,000 fewer children could be born in 2021. Overall, one in three U.S. women said they wanted to get pregnant later or have fewer children because of COVID-19, according to a Guttmacher Institute study. </p>
            <img src="./images/placeholder.jpg">
        <p>The steady decline of the U.S. fertility rates has been going on for decades. With a sharp decrease driven by the 2008 recession, the fertility rates hit a record low in 2019. Then came the pandemic, thrusting many people into an uncertain future and forcing them to make tough decisions about pregnancy. </p>
        <p>As people of color are disproportionately affected by the pandemic, racial disparities were seen in the changing fertility preferences. Many have lost their job after the United States government was forced to shut down the economy. In the first quarter of 2020, African Americans had an unemployed rate of 6.3%, Latino workers at 4.8% and white workers at 3.1%, meaning African Americans had twice the unemployment rate in early 2020. Black and Latina women have seen jobs come back at a slower rate than white women. </p>
        <p>Black and Hispanic women were more likely than White women to state that they wanted to delay pregnancy and were also more concerned about accessing sexual and reproductive health service, according to the study.</p>

        <p>However, Jordan is considering having another baby in because she can work from home right now. </p>
        <p>Even then pregnancy during the pandemic is no easy task.4
        “There's pieces of it that are like, really sad. Two of my best friends had babies a month and a half or two months after me. And I haven't been able to hold them still.”</p>
