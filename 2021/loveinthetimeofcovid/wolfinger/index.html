            fter losing their job in the wake of COVID-19’s mass layoffs, 22-year-old Erin Riley, who uses gender-neutral they/them pronouns, felt directionless. To pay their bills, they started posting pornographic content on the <a target ="_blank" href ="https://onlyfans.com/">OnlyFans website.</a>. The subscription-based platform charges users a monthly fee of anywhere from a couple of dollars to $20 or more to view content and connect with its creators.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the pandemic making face-to-face contact risky, personalized content is infinitely more enticing to those starved for physical and emotional intimacy. The use of OnlyFans has skyrocketed. Within months, Erin had accumulated hundreds of followers and a steady source of income but the intersection of business and intimacy can be difficult to navigate. While some find the OnlyFans platform liberating, others find it debilitating.

        <h3 class = "subhead">
            What is OnlyFans?
        </h3>
        <p>
            OnlyFans was founded in 2016 by <a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/what-is-onlyfans/">Timothy Stokely</a>.  As the <a href="https://www.hulu.com/series/onlyfans-selling-sexy-60c749b8-96a4-48aa-949a-954dc0b14a58">ABC News Original documentary "Selling Sexy"</a> explains, OnlyFans is often described as, "Instagram but for porn." On this subscription-based platform, content creators charge users a monthly fee of anywhere from a couple of dollars to $20 or more to view their feed. Creators include models, influencers, celebrities, porn stars, and everyday people posting images and videos of everything from day to day life to pornographic content. In addition to accessing creators' feed, subscribers can pay to receive private messages and send tips. In return, for an additional fee, creators can produce material specifically for individuals. For many users, OnlyFans is a platform more intimate than pornography. Subscribers feel that they catch a glimpse into the real lives of the people they follow. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. Dulcinea Pitagora, a New York City-based psychotherapist and sex therapist explains that OnlyFans, "provides a boundaried meeting place for people with common interests to safely interact with other people, and to charge for their time."
        </p>
        <p>
            According to <a href = "https://influencermarketinghub.com/onlyfans-stats/">Influencer Marketing Hub</a>, OnlyFans has 50 million registered users. The average earnings on the site are $180 per month but with stories of some individuals bringing in <a href = "https://www.hulu.com/series/onlyfans-selling-sexy-60c749b8-96a4-48aa-949a-954dc0b14a58">over $20,000 a month</a>, hopeful creators continue to sign up. The platform gains 7,000-8,000 creators a day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dr. Pitagora notes OnlyFans, "provides real-time reciprocal exchanges (which) can be particularly meaningful for people who otherwise would watch recorded performances and therefore have no option for back-and-forth communication."
        </p>
        <p>
            In these one-sided or parasocial relationships, followers form bonds with performers even though they have never met outside of a computer screen. They begin to see them as friends and even romantically. What happens when creators invite strangers into their personal lives and interact with them online?
        </p>
        <h3 class="subhead">
            The user perspective
        </h3>
        <p>
            Josiah (who chose to remain anonymous), is an OnlyFans user subscribed to multiple creators. His interactions originated from an urge to help a friend working as a creator who was struggling financially. Once he explored more of what the platform had to offer, he began to enter the intimate lives of those he had never known prior. 
        </p>
        <p>
            "Some have been close friends of mine before subscribing, others have been people that I found myself infatuated with," he said. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In certain intimate contexts, he explained, "there have been conversations that cause me to forget the kind of buyer/seller relationship...there are times when my brain goes 'obviously they are being sweet and attentive because I'm paying.' However, most of the people I message on here are all very kind and attentive."

            A brief history of parasocial relationships
        </h3>
        <p>
            Parasocial relationships existed well before the advent of screens.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It goes back to ancient times, people had celebrity crushes and celebrity followings," said Dr. Riva Tukachinsky of Chapman University who specializes in media psychology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lord Byron, the Romantic poet, received fan mail and even pubic hair from a young woman particularly enamored by him. In the past, parasocial relationships occurred more commonly with fictional characters, well-known athletes and actors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Technology has changed parasocial relationships by making public figures more accessible. During the days of "Beatlemania," fans had to wait for newsletters in the mail or travel to attend a concert. With the development of platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and Snapchat, these one-sided relationships have taken on a new form. Creators are accessible and much more information is at the public's fingertips.
        </p>
        <p>
            As Dr. Tukachinsky says, "you can see Jennifer Lopez in her backyard, Madonna in her bathtub, Kardashian selfies in the bathroom."
        </p>
        <p>
            "Now you can potentially get in touch with one of your favorite celebrities," said Dr. Jaye Derrick of the University of Houston, who researches the influence of parasocial relationships on well-being. "You feel psychologically close to this person and to some extent, you project what you think they are like onto them and you feel like you know who they are.""
        </p>
        <p>
            Tuckachinsky explains that, "obviously, every adult person is able to differentiate between reality and representation of reality so we are not going to jump on the screen to rescue the girl, or smack the TV when we see a snake...but our initial reaction is 'this is real' and then we have to override it and say 'this is not real.'" 
        </p>
        <p>
            This blending of reality and fantasy can be even more confusing when celebrities respond and develop dialogue with viewers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Parasocial relationships used to be based primarily on crushes and feelings of philia or friendship, but with the rise of platforms like OnlyFans, this phenomenon is expanding into the world of sex work. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="subhead">
            But how does this tie into sex work?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Josiah explains that he considers himself a "mom friend" to the users. He says he is motivated to support creators "always wanting to help friends and those I care aobut."
        </p>
        <p>
            Authenticity in a connection is key to Josiah. "The ones I return to, time and time again...are the ones who are genuine...I also think the desire to feel needed, wanted etc. has been amplified by the pandemic. So knowing that I can find methods with which to feel that again draws them back to the site over and over."
        </p>
        <p>
            Josiah notes that "the pandemic has caused my use of the service undulate. There are surges where I tend to subscribe to four or five creators at a time &mdash; often due to a moment of sexual frustration. These are often followed with me removing my card from the site."
        </p>
        <p>
            Although most creators seem genuine, Josiah admits that there are those who "only, understandably, are after your money." He described those types of creators as "predatory," taking advantage of those aforementioned moments of weakness and treating him &mdash; as he phrased it &mdash; "like a cash cow." The creators he chooses to renew his monthly subscriptions to, unsurprisingly, are the ones who appear to take genuine interest in their fans by keeping in contact and creating specialized content for them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since joining the platform last March, Riley has earned just over $4,000, enough to help with a cross-country move to California. Despite landing a job since the move, they've kept posting content to assist with financial security.

            While most of their earnings come through monthly subscription fees, a substantial amount stems from the platform's messaging feature, where fans can pay extra to chat with creators.  Surprisingly, Riley explains that the content of these messages aren't mainly sexual. If the conversations veer in that direction, they'll follow suit, but they're mostly emotionally supportive in nature. Riley's fans provide a substantial amount of reassurance and consolation when their favorite creator is going through a rough patch. And that energy goes both ways.

            Riley doesn't feel that there's a social stigma to their work at OnlyFans. Riley ensures that the people surrounding them "are going to be supportive of everything I do." This includes the likes of their friends, their own mother, and their partner &mdash; who is fine with appearing in content together as long as he's wearing character cosplay.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subhead">
            The impact on creators
        </h3>
        <p>
            OnlyFans creator Rose &mdash; who wished to remain anonymous &mdash; expressed that their experience with the platform is taxing on their mental health. Rose started with OnlyFans last April, a decision they remained hesitatnt about having previously lost a job for camming &mdash; live streaming sexually explicit content to those who wish to buy in. When the pandemic took their job away and New York City rent loomed every closer over their head, Rose turned to OnlyFans. They've made $80 so far.
        </p>
        <p>
            A lot of the comments that Rose received while doing cam work contained pressure on Rose's end &mdash; a non-binary individual &mdash; to present as more feminine to satiate the requests of their audience. As a result, an overwhelming amount of gender dysphoria led to a negative impact on their overall mental state.
        </p>
        <p>
            "It's emotionally draining, even though it's not a live situation. I'm going in a very queer direction...it's not at all helpful when it comes to dysphoria. It makes it really tough, when I intentionally try to feminize myself &mdash; just for the sake of making money &mdash; because I know it'll attract people."
        <p>
            OnlyFans creator, Jen, 30, came to Boston to work as a manager at a restaurant. Then COVID-19 hit in early 2020, she lost her job and OnlyFans presented an option for her like millions of others struggling: a way out of economic insecurity. Economics wasn't the only reason, though.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I find a lot of value in the fun of getting to share my body with total strangers. I appreciated their voyeuristic part in my life," she said. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When asked about the line between the "real world" and the internet, she compared the experience to growing up with chatroom platforms in middle school where she'd have conversations with adult strangers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The conversations were sexual and "totally inappropriate," but as she put it, "I thought it was fucking awesome. Like, this is so cool. I'm never gonna meet these people. This is totally harmless. It's also super fun to explore sexuality in a way that was completely unheard of in my Christian upbringing. So I feel like the disconnect allows us in a way to kind of connect with this  inner desire that we normally can't really express. I can't be walking around in my underwear and being like, 'I'm hot.' You know what I mean? But on the internet, I could."
        </p>
        <p>
            As for her connection to her audience, "For my experience, I was very aware of the disconnect. But I still crave connection, maybe not necessarily romantic, but it felt like it gave me an agency to kind of control that connection, in a way, with strangers."
        </p>
        <p>
            As platforms like OnlyFans start to gain popularity, destigmitization around sex work may become seen as more of a job, especially now with the economic recession and unemployment. Jen considered OnlyFans sex work, since a portion of ineractions are sexual, highlighting the importance of starting a breader conversation about sexuality.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I think it's been a slow growing trend to destigmatize sex work and sex workers having rights...We're all collectively unlearning shitty, judgmental aspects of sexuality, and the world is kind of evolving out of it...We're all  people, and sex work is work. It's a job. It's performance, it's maintenance. It can be dangerous, and it can <i>not</i> be in so many ways. Only Fans kind of keeps people safe. It's a safer option for sex work," she said.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, she liked the opportunity OnlyFans gave her to set her own schedule and payment rates &mdash; comparing it to a streaming service like Disney Plus. But like a streaming service, the need to constantly produce material started to weigh on her; as well as her lack of "sexy" clothing and upgraded camera equipment that could be used to entice more customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            "I felt this weird pressure to have to buy these things to perform for total strangers or my friends. It kind of took out the creativity and curiosity for me. Just kind of started feeling like, 'Oh, ther're so many people that are doing this really well," she said. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="subhead">
            Where do we go from here?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Dr. Derrick believes that during the pandemic, "a lot of people are relying on these parasocial relationships to help them get through and to have connections." She continued, "Parasocial relationships tend to be good for people...(they) protect us from feelings of loneliness and rejection."
        </p>
        <p>
            Moving forward, will the popularity of OnlyFans outlive the pandemic? Dr. Pitagora believes it will:
        </p>
        <p id="closingquote">
            "Online platforms like OnlyFans have been popular with certian groups of people (like sex workers and others who prefer online connections) as long as the platforms have existed. Now that these platforms have gained traction among wider audiences, they'll likely be more popular than they were before, but not quite as highly trafficked once people can safely meet in person again."
