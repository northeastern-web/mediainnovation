</p>

<div class= "mybody">

  <p class= "headline"> Six feet apart. Masks on. Disinfect. It's been a year since the pandemic has pushed people out of arm's reach.</p>

<p>The impact of self-quarantine, isolation and physical distancing have taken a particularly hard toll on college age young people and young adults (ages of 18 and 29). The connections built between friends, family and potential partners have been forced into an unfamiliar dynamic out of their control and, for over a year, without any end in sight.</p>

<p>Yet, there is one place they can find one another: dating apps. Apps, like Bumble, Hinge, Tinder, OkCupid, and Coffee Meets Bagel to name a few, have become increasingly popular modes of communication and connection. Simply put, apps have offered an open window to the world that had previously felt closed by 2020. But now, that desire to meet a match face-to-face is in conflict with the need to be safe.</p>

<p>The pandemic has exposed people to a new sort of loneliness. One that has, for some, blurred the lines between what it means to be lonely and what it means to be alone. "Often people talk about loneliness in terms of being alone," explains New York City psychoanalyst <a href= "https://www.drmichaelchavis.com" target = "_blank">Dr. Michael Chavis</a>, "Loneliness and alone are not the same thing. To be alone is to be without anyone. To be lonely is to be missing them."</p>

<h3>Fighting with Loneliness</h3>

<p>Cameron Hager, a 26-year-old logistics coordinator who lives in Boston, has been working remotely during the pandemic and as a natural extrovert and people person, was having difficulty with the isolation. He recalled how his days began to grow repetitious and as time went on, his desire to see his family and friends grew steadily more intense until, after a fairly normal day at work, he began to cry and couldn't stop.</p>

<div class="mybody">
<p>"I didn't really know what to do with myself," Cameron said, "I was just relentlessly upset and sad and nervous because I don't really know what is happening in the future, four months down the line, or when it's going to end. It was a moment of, I couldn't escape and I was just really looking for an escape."</p>

<p>By the summer, Cameron had returned to dating apps and downloaded Hinge in hopes of restoring a sense of normalcy to his life. For Hager, the risks of meeting someone new during the pandemic was a consideration, but the idea of simply waiting for the pandemic to end and the uncertainty involved was far less appealing.</p>

<p>"Being single at 26, this is the time I'm normally going to be dating, and the pandemic just kind of stopped that, which was fine for a little bit," he said. "But eventually I'm thinking to myself, 'When am I going to be able to go out with somebody again?'."</p>

  <blockquote>
      <p>But eventually I'm thinking to myself, 'When am I going to be able to go out with somebody again?' And around that time, I downloaded it.</p>
  </blockquote>

<p>As the pandemic has stretched onwards, the impact of loneliness and isolation has become all the more pronounced. How people understand their loneliness can sometimes be couched in further negative expression. "Often people who are lonely have all kinds of things that they say to themselves. Negative talk. 'No one wants to be around me.' 'How do I know no one wants to be around me? Because nobody called me all day,'" said Dr. Chavis.</p>

<p>In a survey of 204 people between the ages of 18 and 29, 64% reported dealing with negative emotions more often than they had prior to the pandemic.</p>

<div class="mybody">
<p>Almost all said they have experienced increased loneliness as the pandemic has gone on and around 70% said that their desire to connect with people had increased over the course of the pandemic.</p>
</div> 

<div class="mybodywide">
  <div class="photogridchart">

<div class="mybody">
<p>These results mirror a survey conducted by <a href= "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/21/survey-more-than-7-in-10-gen-zers-report-depression-during-pandemic.html" target = "_blank">CNBC</a> that found that nearly 7 in 10 young adults from the age of 18 to 23 were experiencing loneliness. </p>

<p>Dating apps have profited from this. Match Group, which included major dating apps such as Tinder, Hinge and okCupid, has seen a <a href= "hhttps://ir.mtch.com/news-and-events/quarterly-results/default.aspx" target = "_blank">steady rise</a> in popularity. After a slight drop in the first quarter of last year when the pandemic hit the U.S., the number of subscribers grew dramatically ending the year with a monthly average of over 5 million.</p>
</div> 

<div class="mybodywide">

<div class="mybody"> 

<p>Another giant dating app, Bumble, reported in its <a href="https://ir.bumble.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bumble-inc-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020-results" target="_blank"> financial results</a> ,the app's paying users in the fourth quarter of last year increased to 1.27 million, about a 42.5% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. </p>

<p>For young people like Erlene Tuazaon, a 25-year-old student and receptionist, the balance between the support of friends and family and that of a potential companion and the difference between the two isn't always the easiest to explain or reconcile.</p>

<aside class="pquote">
  <blockquote>
      <p>Since the pandemic started, I was pretty lonely, like to the point that I was depressed,</p>
  </blockquote>
</aside>
  
<p>Erlene explained, "It was to the point that I didn't want to get up anymore, that kind of thing. But I remembered I have family, let me reach out to my family...I started talking more to my family, more to my friends."</p>

<p>Despite her multi-layered support structure, there was something missing that Erlene sought to reach out and claim. She had to explain to a concerned friend that turning to dating apps was less about the support and affection found in friendship and more about the search for something more consistent and more personal.</p>

<div class="mybody">
<p>"Yeah, you could satisfy my needs in caring for me and loving me and everything. 'But there are times,'' I told her, 'I may need affection from somebody else. Not because you're not giving me enough, but the fact that I think that this person could give me x, y, z...I want something to be there with me, a companion.'"</p>

<h3>Risk of Meeting New People</h3>

<p>Yet even as young people flock to dating apps, health concerns are never far from the front of users' minds. People who otherwise wouldn't have asked about someone's health before the pandemic now do.</p>

<p>Before the pandemic, 63% of respondents said that it was very important that they knew a potential match was STI-free.</p>
</div> 

<div class="mybodywide">
  <div class="photogridchart">
  <img src="images/chart3final.png">
</div>
</div>

<div class="mybody">
<p>By comparison, almost 55% of respondents said that they would take someone's word about being COVID free.</p>
</div> 

<div class="mybodywide">
  <div class="photogridchart">
  <img src="images/chart4final.png">
</div>
</div>

<div class="mybody">
<p>Does that mean the desire to connect overrides people's need to be safe? Has the potential for that more intimate connection become more important than being able to confirm, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that the person on the other end of the line is healthy?</p>

<p>For Emma Hoey, a 22 year-old graduate student at Brandeis University, who began using dating apps more seriously during the pandemic, the answer to that question has been a number one priority, especially since learning she has an autoimmune disorder.</p>

<aside class="pquote">
  <blockquote>
      <p>I don't even want to get the common cold, let alone an STI or anything like that. So I'm more cautious now than I ever have been.</p>
  </blockquote>
</aside>

<p>As soon as a rapport has been established and it looks like things might go further, Emma always asks her match to send a screenshot of negative test results. She has never felt uncomfortable asking and fortunately, has yet to have a negative response to her request. "Everyone's been super receptive and understanding that if you're someone high risk, it's not worth it to take the risk," she said.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="mybody">

<p>The benefit of being open and consistent with her position on health concerns has allowed Emma to feel more comfortable when deciding to make the jump from online to offline. When asked what a first date offline would look like, Emma said that she would invite her date for an at-home dinner accompanied by a movie (or television) and something to drink.</p>

<p>"That'll be a good first date,"" she said, "Maybe we'll kiss."</p>

<h3>Others feel even more cautious.</h3>

<p>"I don't trust anyone," said Asha, a 20-year-old sophomore in central Massachusetts who requested that her real name not be used because she has a highly visible role on campus, "I don't. And it's not that I don't believe them...I just don't think we know enough about Covid."</p>

<p>Not even proof of testing or vaccination is enough to change her mind.</p>

<aside class="pquote">
  <blockquote>
      <p>Because there is so much unknown, I'd rather just not engage.</p>
  </blockquote>
</aside>
<p>"It's just the easier choice. And I think that when you look at the cost benefit, it's a lot of anxiety meeting up with someone new right now that I don't think is worth the potential payoff."</p>

<p>For Qi Zhand, a 28-year-old software engineer, dating during the pandemic has been a matter of balancing caution with her desire to meet in person. Qi explained that staying safe with activities that are mindful of public health mandates like social distancing is a good way to meet someone for the first time.</p>

<div class="mybody">
<p>"When I was with my ex, the first time I saw him, we both wore masks and tried to avoid groups of people and tried to have a walk in the park," Qi said, "And later on in the relationship I went to his place.</p>

<aside class="pquote">
  <blockquote>
      <p>I'm not overly cautious, I'd say average.</p>
  </blockquote>
</aside>

<p>Though able to stick to the boundaries she's comfortable with, Qi noted that the conventions of pre-pandemic dating had come up in her dating life and had, at one point, brought her pause when scheduling a date with her current boyfriend.</p>

<p>"He asked me to go to an Indian restaurant to dine in," said Qi, "I texted him back and said I really don't feel comfortable to dine in right now so I think we can do remote chatting instead. Funny thing, he texted me back and said, 'Actually I have the same thought.'"</p>

<h3>Other Relationships Changed Too</h3>

<p>As young people navigate the subtleties of online dating, they have been challenged to consider how they are managing their feelings through their connections with other people, particularly those close to them. Yet when muddled with loneliness, the dynamic can be more complex. "We start to present, when we are lonely, ourselves in ways that the people experiencing us want to be by ourselves. And sometimes, the expectation is that the other would read our minds and meet us on this side of the fence," said Chavis.</p>

<p>Chavis explains that the fundamental dynamics of our relationships have changed. Those close to us, perhaps family living in the same home, can feel too close. Those who we connect to online, without seeing them in person, feel too far. The pandemic has forced people to reconsider how they connect and what significance those connections hold.</p>

<p>Dating apps were the "only avenue to meet people" and "only source of validation," for Thao Tran, a 24-year-old investment manager and teacher in Seattle.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="mybody">
<p>For Thao, who describes herself as a "huge extrovert," loneliness defined 2020, even though she used Tinder, Hinge and Bumble throughout the pandemic.</p>

<p>Thao recalled at one point becoming obsessed with dating apps. The endless swiping made her feel like she was, "literally swiping on all of the population of Seattle."</p>

<aside class="pquote">
  <blockquote>
      <p>I felt so lost. I honestly started verbalizing things where I really don't like myself. Like, I don't know who I am. It was really, really tough for me to do that.</p>
  </blockquote>
</aside>

<p>Eventually, Thao returned home to California, to friends and family. Through spending time with them she found emotional healing. "My emphasis on love right now is my friends and family because they're giving that back to me," she shared.</p>

<p>After returning to Seattle, Thao recalled how she almost went over to a guy's house for a drink but stopped herself. "I actually ended up just sitting and drinking a glass of wine and writing all of my friends Valentine's Day cards," she said.</p>
 
<p>Kacey Quenzer, a 27-year-old buyer for a national power company, felt isolated quickly into quarantine. "I’m a social person, but I was also going through a breakup right when it hit, so that made it harder," she recalls. Even more, Kacey had just moved into her own apartment – an accomplishment she celebrated, but also one that left her even more alone.</p>

<p>She turned to dating apps, particularly Hinge, to find distraction from her breakup and to escape from the walls of her one-bedroom in South Boston.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, she found it hard to make genuine connections on the app. Her surface-level or one-off interactions on the app made her “treasure the genuine connections” she’d already found in her life. </p>  
<aside class="pquote">
  <blockquote>
    <p>I've realized what matters more.</p>
  </blockquote>
</aside>

<p>What mattered most, she now understood, was her previous relationship.  Kacey and her ex-boyfriend, who lives in England, began communicating again. "We talked on and off throughout quarantine, but I was guarded because I was so hurt by what we went through before."</p>

<p>In February of 2021, nearly a year into the pandemic, Kacey had an epiphany. "I called him and told him I was all in."</p>

<p>Kacey notes that quarantine gave her and her ex-boyfriend both the time they needed to really think about what they wanted and to be intentional about moving forward. "We both needed to do some work alone to make this work as a couple. I'm not sure we would've gotten there if life had kept on as normal."</p>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="mybody">

<p>In May, Kacey will fly to England to reunite with him. They have a schedule of visits mapped out for the rest of the year. From there, they'll figure the rest out, together.</p>

<p>The pandemic has challenged long held notions of our relationships and how we connect. It has highlighted the issues born when self-esteem and self-validation are rooted in confirmation from others. And perhaps, for some, exposed the anxieties of being alone after having been alone for so long.</p>

<p>"I think that people seek that kind of closeness, a direct love relationship, that grows out of an ongoing feeling of isolation. The wish to be with someone. To know you are with someone...They wish for that oneness because there's a kind of paranoia of being alone. That oneness is about fighting that paranoia. About fighting the fear that one is left without," said Dr. Chavis.</p>

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

<p>Whatever the "new normal" may look like for relationships, it's clear that how they are formed, maintained and valued has changed. Whether striking up conversation in public social settings or through dating apps, the experiences of the pandemic may impact how those interactions are navigated. "Has this person taken proper public health precautions?" "Am I really ready to meet someone in person?" "How much longer can I be happy being single?"</p>

<p>Will people be eager and open to connect, like Cam? Vigilant about their health yet open to meet, like Emma? Will some still be uncertain about meeting in person, like Asha? Or perhaps, like Thao, find strong connections in familial and friendly spaces? "My emphasis on love right now is my friends and family because they're giving that back to me," said Thao.</p>
