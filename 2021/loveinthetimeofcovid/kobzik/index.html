  <h1>The rise of OnlyFans: when COVID-19 met the loneliness pandemic</h1>

    After losing their job in the wake of COVID-19’s mass layoffs, 22-year-old Erin Riley, who uses gender-neutral
    they/them pronouns, felt directionless. To pay their bills, they crossed the fence and started posting pornographic
    content on the OnlyFans website.

  </p>
  <blockquote>
    In an age where the pandemic has forced people into quarantine, the appeal of personalized content is made
    infinitely more enticing to those starved for physical and emotional intimacy. The use of OnlyFans has skyrocketed.

  <p>In an age where the pandemic has forced people into quarantine, the appeal of personalized content is made
    infinitely more enticing to those starved for physical and emotional intimacy. The use of OnlyFans has skyrocketed.
  </p>

    <h3>What is OnlyFans?</h3>
 
  <p>
    OnlyFans was founded in 2016 by Timothy Stokely. As the ABC News Original documentary “Selling Sexy” explains, OnlyFans
is often described as, “Instagram but for porn.” On this subscription-based platform, content creators charge users a
monthly fee of anywhere from a couple of dollars to $20 or more to view their feed. Creators include models,
influencers, celebrities, porn stars, and everyday people posting images and videos of everything from day to day life
to pornographic content. In addition to accessing creators' feed, subscribers can pay to receive private messages and
send tips. In return, for an additional fee, creators can produce material specifically for individuals. For many users,
OnlyFans is a platform more intimate than pornography. Subscribers feel that they catch a glimpse into the real lives of
the people they follow.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dr. Dulcinea Pitagora, a New York City-based psychotherapist and sex therapist explains that OnlyFans, “provides a
    boundaried meeting place for people with common interests to safely interact with other people, and to charge for their
    time.”
  </p>
  <p>
    According to Influencer Marketing Hub, OnlyFans has 50 million registered users. The average earnings on the site are
    $180 per month but with stories of some individuals bringing in over $20,000 a month, hopeful creators continue to sign
    up. The platform gains 7,000-8,000 creators a day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Dr. Pitagora notes OnlyFans, “provides real-time reciprocal exchanges (which) can be particularly meaningful for people
who otherwise would watch recorded performances and therefore have no option for back-and-forth communication.”

  </p>
  <p>
    In these one-sided or parasocial relationships, followers form bonds with performers even though they have never met
outside of a computer screen. They begin to see them as friends and even romantically. What happens when creators invite
strangers into their personal lives and interact with them online?
  </p>

    <h3> User Perspective </h3>

  <p>
    Josiah (who chose to remain anonymous), is an OnlyFans user subscribed to multiple creators. He first visited the
platform to help a friend working as a creator who was struggling financially. Once he explored more of what the
platform had to offer, he began to enter the intimate lives of those he had never known prior.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Some have been close friends of mine before subscribing, others have been people that I found myself infatuated with,”
he said.
  </p>
  <p>
    In certain intimate contexts, he explained, “there have been conversations that cause me to forget the kind of
buyer/seller relationship . . . there are times when my brain goes ‘obviously they are being sweet and attentive because
I’m paying.’ However, most of the people I message on here are all very kind and attentive.”
  </p>
  <p>
   <h3>Parasocial Relationships</h3>
  </p>
  <p>
    Parasocial relationships existed well before the advent of screens.
  </p>
  <p>
    “It goes back to ancient times, people had celebrity crushes and celebrity followings,” said Dr. Riva Tukachinsky of
Chapman University who specializes in media psychology.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lord Byron, the Romantic poet, received fan mail and even pubic hair from a young woman particularly enamored by him. In
    the past, parasocial relationships occurred more commonly with fictional characters, well known athletes and actors.
  </p>
  <p>
As Dr. Tukachinsky says, “you can see Jennifer Lopez in her backyard, Madonna in her bathtub, Kardashian selfies in the bathroom.”

  </p>
  <p>
    “Now you can potentially get in touch with one of your favorite celebrities,” said Dr. Jaye Derrick of the University of
Houston, who researches the influence of parasocial relationships on well-being. “You feel psychologically close to this
person and to some extent, you project what you think they are like onto them and you feel like you know who they are.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Tuckachinsky explains that, “obviously, every adult person is able to differentiate between reality and representation
of reality so we are not going to jump on the screen to rescue the girl, or smack the TV when we see a snake . . . but
our initial reaction is ‘this is real’ and then we have to override it and say ‘this is not real.’”
  </p>
  <p>
    This blending of real and fantasy can be even more confusing when celebrities respond and develop dialogue with viewers.
  </p>
  <p>
    
Parasocial relationships used to be based primarily on crushes and feelings of philia or friendship, but with the rise
of platforms like OnlyFans, this phenomenon is expanding into the world of sex work.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Users</h3>
  </p>
  <p>
    Josiah explains that he considers himself a “mom friend” to the users. He says he is motivated to support creators
“always wanting to help friends and those I care about.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Authenticity in a connection is key to Josiah. “The ones I return to time and time again . . . are the ones who are
genuine. . . . I also think the desire to feel needed, wanted, etc, has been amplified by the pandemic. So knowing that
I can find methods with which to feel that again draws them back to the site over and over.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Josiah explains “the pandemic has caused my use of service to undulate. There are surges where I tend to subscribe to
four or five creators at a time, often due to a moment of sexual frustration. These are often followed with me removing
my card from the site.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Although most creators seem genuine, Josiah admits that there are those who “only, understandably, are after your
money.” He described those types of creators as “predatory,” taking advantage of those aforementioned moments of
weakness and treating him — as he phrased it — “like a cash cow.” The creators he chooses to renew his monthly
subscriptions to, unsurprisingly, are the ones who take genuine interest in their fans by keeping in contact and
creating specialized content for them.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Creators</h3>
  </p>
  <p>
    Since joining the platform last March, Riley has earned just over $4,000, enough to help with a cross-country move to
California. Despite landing a job since the move, they’ve kept posting content to assist with financial security.
  </p>
  <p>
    While most of their earnings come through monthly subscription fees, a substantial amount stems from the platform’s
messaging feature, where fans can pay extra to chat with creators. Surprisingly, Riley explains that the content of
these messages aren’t mainly sexual. If the conversations veer in that direction, they’ll follow suit, but they’re
mostly emotionally supportive in nature. Riley’s fans provide a substantial amount of reassurance and consolation when
their favorite creator is going through a rough patch. And that energy goes both ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I do the same for them anytime they offer support for me, from an emotional and mental standpoint,” Riley said. “Rather
than just financial, because it really does help a lot to have that support. So I try to offer that as much as I
possibly can for them. And a lot of them do that for me as well”.
  </p>
  <p>
    Riley doesn’t feel that there’s a social stigma to their work on OnlyFans. Riley ensures that the people surrounding
them “are going to be supportive of everything I do.” This includes the likes of their friends, their own mother, and
their partner — who is fine with appearing in content together as long as he’s wearing character cosplay.
  </p>
  <p>
    OnlyFans creator Rose — who wished to remain anonymous — expressed that their experience with the platform is taxing
their mental health. Rose started with OnlyFans last April, a decision they remained hesitant about having previously
lost a job for camming — live streaming sexually explicit content to those who wish to buy in. When the pandemic took
their job away and New York City rent loomed ever closer over their head, Rose turned to OnlyFans. They’ve made $80 so
far.
  </p>
  <p>
    A lot of the comments that Rose received while doing cam work contained pressure on Rose’s end — a non-binary individual
— to present as more feminine to satiate the requests of their audience. As a result, an overwhelming amount of gender
dysphoria led to a negative impact on their overall mental state.
  </p>
  <p>
    “It’s emotionally draining, even though it’s not a live situation. I’m going in a very queer direction . . . it’s not at
all helpful when it comes to dysphoria. It makes it really rough, when I intentionally try to feminize myself. Just for
the sake of making money, because I know it’ll attract people.”
  </p>
  <p>
    OnlyFans creator, Jen, 30, came to Boston to work as a manager at a restaurant. Then COVID-19 hit in early 2020, she
lost her job and OnlyFans presented an option for her like millions of others struggling: a way out of economic
insecurity. Economics wasn’t the only reason though.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I find a lot of value in the fun of getting to share my body with total strangers. I appreciated their voyeuristic part
in my life,” she said.
  </p>
  <p>
    When asked about the line between the “real world” and the internet, she compared the experience to growing up with
chatroom platforms in middle school when she’d have conversations with adult strangers.
  </p>
  <p>
    The conversations were sexual and “totally inappropriate”, but as she put it, “I thought it was fucking awesome. Like,
this is so cool. I'm never gonna meet these people. This is totally harmless. It's also super fun to explore sexuality
in a way that was completely unheard of in my Christian upbringing. So I feel like the disconnect allows us in a way to
kind of connect with this inner desire that we normally can't really express. I can't be walking around in my underwear
and being like, ‘I'm hot.’ You know what I mean? But on the internet, I could.”
  </p>
  <p>
    As for her connection to her audience, “For my experience, I was very aware of the disconnect. But I still crave
connection, maybe not necessarily romantic, but it felt like it gave me an agency to kind of control that connection, in
a way with strangers.”
  </p>
  <p>
    As platforms like OnlyFans start to gain popularity, destigmitization around sex work may become seen as more of a job,
especially now with the economic recession and unemployment. Jen considered OnlyFans sex work if people are being on
sexual on it and highlighted the importance of starting a broader conversation about sexuality.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I think it's been a slow growing trend to destigmatize sex work and sex workers having rights… We're all collectively
unlearning shitty, judgmental aspects of sexuality and the world is kind of evolving out of it… We're all people and sex
work is work. It's a job. It’s performance, it’s maintenance. It can be dangerous and it cannot be in so many ways.
OnlyFans kind of keeps people safe. It's a safer option for sex work,” she said.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, she liked the opportunity OnlyFans gave her to set her own schedule and payment rates comparing it to a
streaming service like Disney Plus. But like a streaming service, the need to constantly produce material started to
weigh on her as well as her lack of “sexy” clothing or nice camera that might be used to entice more customers.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I felt this weird pressure to have to buy these things to perform for total strangers or my friends. It kind of took
out the creativity and curiosity for me. Just kind of started feeling like, ‘Oh, they're so many people that are doing
this really well,” she said.
  </p>
  <p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  </p>
  <p>
    Dr. Derrick believes that during the pandemic, “a lot of people are relying on these parasocial relationships to help
them get through and to have connections.” She continued, “Parasocial relationships tend to be good for people . . .
(and) protect us from feelings of loneliness and rejection.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Moving forward, will the popularity of OnlyFans outlive the pandemic? Dr. Pitagora believes it will: “Online platforms
like OnlyFans have been popular with certain groups of people (like sex workers and others who prefer online connections
to in-person as long as the platforms have existed. Now that these platforms have gained traction among wider audiences,
they’ll likely be more popular than they were before, but not quite as highly trafficked once people can safely meet
in-person again.”
